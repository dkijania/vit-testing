    "proposal_brief": "INTRODUCTION  \r\nVOTERS PLEASE UNDERSTAND: This is a Fund 7 COMMUNITY CHALLENGE others will make proposals to the challenge. It is NOT a proposal itself. Therefore do not expect to see the same things you see in proposals, like teams, solutions and budgets. The proposers who apply for this CHALLENGE create those things.\r\n\r\n++What are Non-Fungible Tokens?++\r\n\r\nA non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n*THE CHALLENGE:  \r\nPropose a means or way to drive business use cases on Cardano that have NFT usage as a core component and can act as an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. This can include any business model based on NFTs. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.*  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GROW CARDANO  \r\nThis Challenge is about building recurring businesses that incorporate NFTs on the Cardano ecosystem. The more types of NFTs that are circulating on Cardano will increase the utility of Cardano and ADA.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRATIONALE\r\n\r\nFeedback suggests most people need help imaging use cases for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) beyond the recent Digital Art phenomenon and can't imagine other use cases without some inspiration.\r\n\r\nTo our thinking, the recent Art NFT boom is a small fraction of the trillions of dollars the NFT market will represent in the next decade. And since there are already many Digital Art NFT projects underway in Catalyst, this challenge is about expanding the use cases beyond simply Digital Art. It does not preclude all art forms however, so if you have ideas for other business models that are also considered part of the broader category of the Arts, those are welcome proposals. Even so, no use case would technically not qualify, even Digital Art. It is merely the intention to reach beyond to other use cases.\r\n\r\nThis Challenge is about increasing worldwide uses of NFTs in everyday transactions, especially on Cardano with business uses that can easily benefit from NFT technology.\r\n\r\n++BUDGET RATIONALE++\r\n\r\nI propose a $200,000 budget which would accommodate four (4) $50K submissions on average and give each a fair shot of making something that could make a significant difference in the ecosystem. This is 1/4 of the $800,000 budget for something that has a trillion dollar potential in the next decade.\r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD BE PROPOSED\r\n\r\nProposals should be framed towards specific use-cases, and the community will know of specific cases where NFTs can be used to solve various problems. Focusing on NFTs in general may be most productive, with a strong focus on business models that rely on NFTs as a core component of most transactions.\r\n\r\nWe believe many community members will have good ideas on where NFTs could be adopted and believe at a functional level, the community has a lot to say about it.\r\n\r\nThis is important for Cardano's future and could be the base for many dApps on Cardano where it is vital to uniquely identify the other party. This is a call for exploring the possibilities where NFTs could be one of the products or service that drives mass user adoption of Cardano.\r\n\r\nThis is a relevant topic with importance to not only Cardano since the Mary hard fork and UTxOma introduction, but blockchain and cryptocurrency in general and will have a global impact. Cardano an multi-asset functionality make Cardano an excellent candidate to dominate the NFT futures market. Build something that can make that happen!\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF USES FOR PROPOSAL INSPIRATION\r\n\r\nDigital content\r\n\r\nGaming items\r\n\r\nDomain names\r\n\r\nPhysical items\r\n\r\nInvestments and collateral\r\n\r\nInsurance\r\n\r\nContent management/distribution\r\n\r\nData management\r\n\r\nFinancial Services\r\n\r\nManufacturing and industrial\r\n\r\nStorage\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\nRetail\r\n\r\nTransport and Tourism\r\n\r\nMedia\r\n\r\nRealEstate\r\n\r\nLand Registry\r\n\r\nIdentification\r\n\r\nAdvertising\r\n\r\nAuthorship and ownership\r\n\r\nSocial Network\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CAMPAIGN BRIEF\r\n\r\nNFT use case development is mission critical because user adoption will have a key role in determining the future utility and value of Cardano. That's why we are looking to the Project Catalyst community to refine and answer our challenge.\r\n\r\nOver time, development opportunities on Cardano will evolve to include everything from NFTs, DIDs, metadata to KEVM/IELE, Plutus, Marlowe, Glow and more. Ultimately, the goal here is best summarized by the question:\r\n\r\nDid the funded NFT use cases manage to drive user-adoption?\r\n\r\nTo find out, we might track the following metrics:\r\n\r\nHow many daily active users?\r\n\r\nHow much daily local token volume increased?\r\n\r\nHow many transactions were made?\r\n\r\nHow much funds were transacted?\r\n\r\n++Guiding questions++\r\n\r\nWhere are gaps in the market where NFTs originating on Cardano have a unique advantage?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of NFT solutions can already be developed in the next six months?\r\n\r\n++Inspirational potential directions++\r\n\r\nThe community open roadmap contains a \"Use cases\" section and \"Driving adoption\" section that can serve as an inspiration for proposers.\r\n\r\n++Developer resources++\r\n\r\nFor access to all currently available developer tools and guides, visit our developer site. Further documentation can be found here.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, here are some quick links you can start with:\r\n\r\nhttps://developers.cardano.org/en/development-environments/native-tokens/native-tokens/  \r\n\r\nhttps://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-tokens/150  \r\n\r\nhttps://forum.cardano.org/t/documentation-how-to-create-ada-nfts/50131  \r\n\r\n++Metadata++  \r\n\r\nMetadata tells the story of transactions made on the blockchain. Cardano is working to provide cutting edge tools for embedding data into transactions and while adding robust search functionality in the block explorer. Check out our blog on metadata or look at our documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n++The Marlowe playground++\r\n\r\nMarlowe is our bespoke domain specific language (DSL) built for creating robust financial smart contracts on Cardano.

What use is having the record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, if the work that it points to is no longer accessible? Only the metadata gets stored on the blockchain, if the file it points to is no longer available because the centralised storage it was hosted on is down, the NFT itself loses its value, regardless if it's a piece of digital art, music, or a land lease.\r\n\r\nPicture how the media would cover the story of an NTF artwork that somebody paid hundreds of thousands of dollars suddenly not being there anymore. After an event such as that, storage permanence would surely become the biggest thing the general public would be concerned about. We can anticipate this by building it into the system from the get-go and setting it up as one of the key differentiators because there's a possibility it'll end up being.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/cloud-storage-market-102773\r\n\r\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-storage-a-deep-dive-by-filecoin\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives",

Looking to try and learn how this all works?  \r\nHoping to find others to collaborate with or just prefer to start small?  \r\nThen this might just be the right challenge for you :)\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe Idea:  \r\nForm a team, make a proposal, get to work and deliver in 8 weeks (starting from insight sharing).  \r\nProposers are encouraged to collaborate and merge their proposals along the way.  \r\nIn the end all should have delivered by the time the community votes, so they are the judge of this Hackathon.  \r\nProposals should be judged on the value they delivered at that the time of voting\r\n\r\n  \r\nRules:  \r\n minimum 2 co-proposers  \r\n max 5k budget per proposal (not including work after the deadline)  \r\n max 1 proposal (main or co) per person within this challenge  \r\n no referrals (to avoid abuse)\r\n\r\n  \r\nReasoning:  \r\nThe total funds for the challenge and max funds per proposal are limited. This allows for new proposers and teams that are just forming to experiment without interfering with the larger and more mission critical challenges. No one is asking for the world here, so please be mindfull of eachother when providing feedback!\r\n\r\n  \r\n(V)CA Guide / rating rules:  \r\nBecause many small proposals can overburden the CA system, a simple rule set is provided to simplify CA work in this challenge. Any proposal that follows the rules as mentioned above should get a 5 rating, no explanation has to be given but feedback is ofcourse welcome. If a proposal does not follow the rules it should get a rating 1 with an explanation/ reference to the rule. The actual judgement of value is left to the voters.",

On the other hand, proposals that are not open and perform poorly will worsen their reputation and decrease the chances of being voted on by the community.

    "proposal_brief": "Bitcoin is now widely referred to as a first-generation blind, deaf and mute blockchain that sought out to find out will decentralized technology work at all.  \r\nLater the community realized they wanted more from blockchains—things like programmability and scalability. This is where Ethereum, or the second-generation of the technology, came in and made a revolution in the industry. However it suffers from a lack of scalability and problems with decentralizing governance, as well as from other teething problems that were inbuilt into the code.  \r\nCardano and several other third generation crypto currencies are looking to science to provide the theoretical foundations for key building blocks and elements of their infrastructure. Some more, some less.  \r\nWe all know that interoperability will also be one of the defining characteristics of a decentralized system that services into the future. However, interoperability will not only refer to the technical blockchain side - increasingly we will require interoperability on governance, funding, community, research and other aspects.  \r\nFurthermore, by building and linking interoperable chains - risks (governance, stability, etc.) posed to one chain may spill over to other chains.  \r\nHence in real-life, community integrations are important as they lead to a common realization of joint interests, instead of a destructive Hunger Games mentality in which blockchains fight each other to extinction.  \r\nThe improvement of all science coins is a win for all, especially in an open source universe such as this. The destruction of all science coins could also eventually lead to the demise of the last coin left standing.  \r\nThere is no victory when diversity is lost in an ecosystem. That's the very point of decentralization.  \r\nTo use another botanical analogy, it is no wonder that the most vibrant genotypes in the plant world are created from hybridization (cross-pollination).  \r\nCardano itself is a by-product of cross-pollination of ideas. This idea is a basic principle worth funding and could lead to massive gains for each and every \"science coin\" ecosystem.  \r\nThe Cardano community should not leave the responsibility of cooperation to IOHK, Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation. They have provided momentum, we all have a responsibility to keep the ball rolling and to expand the playing field.  \r\nThe proposed budget takes into account the need to initiate contacts and elaborate modes of cooperation, which is the object of the challenge. Further initiatives could ensue through this newly-established cooperation, which could result in new Challenges and new Funding requests in the future.  \r\nHence, the proposed USD75,000 budget was set to be sufficiently large to motivate creativity and ideas, which could eventually lead to new funding rounds.  \r\nImportant note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD75,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if this is selected as a future Challenge.",

    "proposal_brief": "\"We are the ones we have been waiting for\" - June Jordan\r\n\r\n\"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\" - Nelson Mandela\r\n\r\nLet's propose ideas that are designed with sustainability at it's heart, guided by the same founding principle on which Cardano was built upon.\r\n\r\n++Urgent solutions for urgent times++\r\n\r\nMore people around the world are living better lives compared to just a decade ago. More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains.\r\n\r\nWith the world increasingly facing the extremely damaging impacts of climate change upon ecosystems, populations and species, the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C cannot be contested. Alarming data includes the loss of primary rainforest equivalent to a football pitch every 6 seconds in 2019 leading to dramatic consequences such as soil erosion, flooding, loss of biodiversity, carbon release or fishery livelihoods being threatened in small island developing countries, or the Coral Triangle region in South-East Asia due to warming water temperatures and coral bleaching.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the 2020-2030 decade of action is the need for action to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency. Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\r\n\r\nSustainable development calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\r\n\r\nFor sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are interconnected, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.\r\n\r\nAction against climate change entails structural behavioural change at an individual and systemic level to embed sustainable practices.\r\n\r\nThis will entail the adoption of a new framework of thinking to ensure sustainability is embedded at all levels of action, well beyond the social sector, and includes all strata of society.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe critical core competencies required for sustainability include:\r\n\r\n• Critical and systemic thinking - promoting and ensuring all learners acquire knowledge, embed values and develop the skills needed to promote sustainable development. Being able to discern and distinguish greenwashing from genuine sustainability, and shifting from thinking in siloes to thinking holistically and embracing complexity\r\n\r\n• Collaborative decision making - ensuring multilateral action so no one is left behind and the empowerment of all communities\r\n\r\n• Taking responsibility for the present and future generations - ensuring sustainable, alternative lifestyles and ideas from the consumer society and beyond are promoted and adopted by the global society\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWith such critical competencies in place, sustainability can be achieved, with the fulfilment of the SDGs within the necessary time.\r\n\r\n  \r\n• Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.\r\n\r\n• Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet\r\n\r\n• To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, annual investment requirements across all sectors have been estimated at around $5-7 trillion. Current investment levels are far from the scale needed. With global financial assets estimated at over $200 trillion, financing is available, but most of these resources are not being channelled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed necessary to achieve the SDGs and objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\n• Interest and investment in the Sustainable Development Goals are growing and investment in the Goals makes economic sense. Achieving the SDGs could open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities and create 380 million new jobs by 2030.  \r\n\r\n++Cardano Sustainability++\r\n\r\nEncouraging the growth of a Community Led Local Hubs Network as a means of accelerating and expanding the Cardano ecosystem in strategic places for high SDG impact:\r\n\r\nOut of the world's approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 6.45 billion do not speak English as their first language. Living in the Western world, one may forget this fact, with many never having considered it.\r\n\r\nLet's consider it now.\r\n\r\nLet's build an ecosystem that grows sustainably, in harmony from the local to global scale, while remaining inclusive and equitable.\r\n\r\nWhen you drive grassroots adoption, you do more than just 'build cool products'; you empower people to change their lives and world in previously unimaginable ways. You give them the tools to imagine that anything is possible.\r\n\r\nRemember that the Bitcoin network is one protocol of the 75% of blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining power to reach consensus.\r\n\r\nWith consensus on the Cardano blockchain through Ouroboros estimated to be over four-million times more energy-efficient than the Bitcoin protocol - let's use the tools available to us today to help build a sustainable world.\r\n\r\nIn a world where Cardano exists, maybe we don't have to wish for these things to happen, we make them happen!\r\n\r\nEACH PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD FOR THIS CHALLENGE CAN REQUEST FUNDS AMOUNTING TO NO MORE THAN A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE A DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS WITHIN THE SDG FRAMEWORK :)\r\n\r\n++Guiding Budget Rationale:++\r\n\r\n*   Basic infrastructure costs\r\n*   Developer Training, Education and Tools\r\n*   Catalyst Proposer Onboarding\r\n*   Translation and Outreach\r\n*   And more…\r\n\r\n++For more information:++\r\n\r\n\\* https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/  \r\n\\* https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launch-esd-2030-roadmap-africa-region  \r\n\\* https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000374802  \r\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/world-computers-that-don-t-cost-the-earth/41259  \r\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/consensus-on-cardano-vs-other-blockchains/38738  \r\n\r\n++Videos on Sustainable Development Goals:++\r\n\r\n\\* https://youtu.be/0XTBYMfZyrM - Do you know all SDGs?  \r\n\\* https://youtu.be/vc8-7VncIbA - UN Chief on Decade of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals  \r\n\\* https://youtu.be/xVWHuJOmaEk - Nations United: Urgent Solutions for Urgent Times | Presented by Thandiwe Newton",

    "proposal_brief": "Ada Lovelace was a woman.  \r\nThe brief is simple. We all benefit from including more women and the female perspective to the Cardano ecosystem.  \r\nThis funding challenge isn't devised to promote: (a) diversity training, (b) hiring tests, (c) performance ratings and/or (d) quotas.  \r\nhttps://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail  \r\nOne of the ideas behind this proposal is to gradually better reflect the reality of the world in the Cardano ecosystem as a whole and promote social accountability—to continue promoting fair-mindedness.  \r\nCardano has a unique opportunity to expand its ecosystem to onboard humanity's oft-neglected source of talent and resourcefulness: women. We are in a position to attract great female talent - which may be the Catalyst for even more female involvement.  \r\nThe Cardano ecosystem can decide to address identity considerations that act as barriers to entering the technology sector and that some high-cognitive skill women do not apply because of their high identity costs.  \r\nSome research has shown that changing the perception that women cannot succeed in technology can be achieved by providing role models, information on returns and access to a female network:  \r\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3266427  \r\nEventually all blockchain platforms will turn to expanding their userbase and stakeholder bases, so we can get an advantage by starting early. It may seem non-essential now, but speeding up adoption is a common goal for all Cardano stakeholders.  \r\nCardano was the blockchain platform that achieved an unprecedented success a few years ago when an all-female class of highly driven women became the very first African class trained to develop and build on Cardano, the first third generation blockchain to evolve out of a scientific philosophy. The initiative was born out of a signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between IOHK - the company overseeing the technical development of Cardano, and the Ethiopian government in May 2018.  \r\nhttps://emurgo.io/ja/blog/the-inaugural-all-female-african-class-of-cardano-ada-blockchain-developers  \r\nOn the negative side, many in the community are aware of opposite examples such as this one:  \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/md4e7y/the_misogyny_on_the_cardano_360_live_chat_was/  \r\nSo, in that spirit, let's show our true colors - by supporting social accountability, promoting fair-mindedness and respectful communication.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe proposed budget has been set at USD150,000 after taking into consideration the importance of the challenge and also the need to ensure that if this challenge is accepted, there will be sufficient funding for more than symbolic or token projects.  \r\n  \r\nOn the other hand, setting the budget higher might make it less likely for the challenge to be approved. So, a balanced budgetary proposal has been submitted.  \r\n  \r\nImportant note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. The proposed budget of USD150,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if this is selected as a future Challenge.",

Maybe proposers can develop a way of incentivizing further SPO participation in the Cardano testnet and more simulations.  \r\n  \r\nIt is great that IOHK/IOG is currently spearheading efforts, but SPOs should also initiate a decentralized and coordinated effort that could complement the existing activities.\r\n\r\nResponsibility cannot be centralized, it is best if it is shared.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of a system's stability is the fact that the system is able to look at itself in the mirror and rebuild itself in real time to adapt to environmental threats.  \r\nThreats to stakepool operators are direct threats to the system itself.  \r\nThere is a wide range of potential risks that both need to be identified and mitigated. These do not only include network-related parameters and threats, but also potentially social engineering / hacking risks, cybersecurity, impersonations, political and regulatory risks, business risks, etc.  \r\n  \r\nStakepool operators may be wary of taking their pools offline for any type of stress testing as they might lose the opportunity to forge blocks and they may lose rewards and delegators.  \r\n  \r\nThis might be addressed as part of this challenge, where SPOs might be rewarded in some form for taking part in these essential activities.  \r\n  \r\nIt would be good if SPOs would take an active part in submitting proposals for this challenge -as they are the beneficiaries and the best candidates to address the issues at stake.  \r\n  \r\nThe budget has been set at USD150,000 as it is a critical element of network safety.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nImportant note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD150,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.

This in itself is democratic, but voting is a democratic mechanism, while true democracy is a system that allows minority view to flourish and eventually - if they are healthy and sound - grow to become a majority view.  \r\nCryptocurrencies emerged partly as a reaction to the established system and the established way of doing business. Cryptocurrencies are in essence a reaction to the establishment. However as crypto starts going mainstream a new class of tech savvy early entrants become part of the new establishment.  \r\n  \r\nThere is a risk of missing radical talent and great innovators as the Cardano ecosystem becomes more complex. There will be multiple layers of \"middle decentralized management\" and more institutions in charge of running the protocol, creating dapps, running nodes, community advisors, consulting companies, etc…  \r\nEvery groundbreaking idea is in its essence a minority view at the very outset.  \r\n\"Today's \"best practices\" lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.\"  \r\nThe issue is how can we prevent the continuous exclusion or sidelining of minority, contrarian views on key elements of the Cardano ecosystem in order to avoid driving away new visionaries and regressing into an echo chamber environment?  \r\nIf the new Satoshi Nakamoto or the new Charles Hoskinson or the new Steve Jobs is lurking in the shadows of the current Cardano ecosystem and has radical new ideas, will the system embrace him/her - or leave them standing at the gates?  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\"The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt is probable that radical innovation ideas will not be understandable immediately to the voting majority of stakeholders and the system may shun future visionaries.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we ensure we don't lose this visionary and give him/her some room to play and some time to develop the vision, instead of just slamming the door? Maybe some key tenets of the Cardano ecosystem need to be revisited?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo we need a special sandbox environment for radically novel ideas and plans that could not attract normal funding, but could thrive with a little Catalyst magic?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow can this be resolved?\r\n\r\nThe proposed limited size of budget for this challenge is designed to motivate proposers to address this issue with initial proposals and projects, as it a challenge that lays the ground to ensuring the continued vibrancy of the Cardano ecosystem. If we plant seeds to longevity early, we can benefit reap the results a long time from now.\r\n\r\n  \r\nImportant note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD30,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.

    "proposal_brief": "Can Project Catalyst's First NFT Art draw a worldwide Declaration of Independence? 🌎🌍🌏\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, because decentralization is localization, and money is only as good as its art.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(The following is only my example of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art, but it is not THE solution.)\r\n\r\n  \r\nVISION 👀:\r\n\r\nUtilizing the synesthesia of sight and sound through abstract representation as seen/heard in \"Idle, Torrent,\" our NFT can appeal to a worldwide audience.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis worldwide audience can be educated visually on the mechanics of the Cardano Roadmap/Logosphere (Ouroboros, Daedalus, ADA, Voltaire, Catalyst etc.) and educated philosophically through a chain reaction as seen in \"3M Brand Rube Goldberg Machine.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe depiction of this chain reaction through digital Japanese style 2-D animation as seen in \"Machine 機械 Sakuga MAD 2\" can boost participation in Japan, where Cardano's Initial Coin Offering took place.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBy directing this Japanese style 2-D animation from the actual Cardano Source Code script as seen in \"How to Create Word Cloud Text Portrait Designs!,\" the gap between programming and non-programming language can heal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf this programming and non-programming language barrier heals, inconceivable possibilities materialize as seen in the commercial success of the \"Matrix He is the one 1080p Full HD.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nA commercial success of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art is the fruit of the Cardano network's labor. \"How Trees Secretly Talk to Each Other in the Forest | Decoder.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nNFT SHOWCASE 📽:\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue facing NFT art is how to showcase the certifiably purchased art.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI propose a solution using movie theaters, which have the largest ubiquitously available screens and social seatings, to showcase Project Catalyst's First NFT Art 🌅.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIf Project Catalyst is successful in displaying its art in a movie theater using a proof of concept approach to identity certification with NFT, not only will sale price and media attention increase, but also, the cultural foundation for Pokemon style NFT \"battles\" at movie theaters becomes a real possibility.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWith the media attention surrounding public support of Gamestop and AMC, Project Catalyst can show one solution to the public that conventional finance never would.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBUSINESS🤑:\r\n\r\nAnimated films announce rates of anywhere from $10,000 to more than $200,000 per minute.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWith this huge range, I think it is safe to assume closer to the $200,000 mark with the complexity of my proposed task (with a length between ~3:14 to 7:12).\r\n\r\n  \r\nHowever, with the fresh Cardano market, the Project Catalyst stamp of approval, the work with NFT-DAO, the media attention, the sale price, and the showcase use case, it is a big risk for a big reward.\r\n\r\nUsing a Multi-Level Marketing style rewards based system with ADA for larger contributions and NFT for smaller contributions, we can give merit based rewards for each section of the completed work, no matter how small. This will facilitate the division of labor and create an assembly line system. A finder's fee can be given to community members that find specialized labor, including animators, a venue owner, musician, programmers that draw etc.\r\n\r\nAUCTION ✋:\r\n\r\nAfter the showcase of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art, an auction reaction livestream by Charles Hoskinson (and potentially other IOG members) to the bidding would be ideal (if said people wanted to of course.)\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn addition, the auction's bidding would take place in Fibonacci numbers to produce maximum excitement.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe NFT smart contract would embed this logic as well, so later sales maintain the Fibonacci sequence.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPROJECT CATALYST COMMUNITY BUILDING🔄:\r\n\r\nThrough the lens of this Fund7 challenge proposal, I believe every current Fund5 challenge setting can be adapted to further the use case of Project Catalyst's First NFT Art.\r\n\r\n  \r\nCommunity members can feel free to propose ideas in collaboration with this proposal in Fund5 challenges.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKeep in mind, 80% of Internet traffic (data wise) is video.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTherefore, all Fund5 challenges combine for $1,700,000 and 80% of Fund5= $1,360,000.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis would be an unheard of collaboration within the community, so an unheard of figure is not out of the question in my opinion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nProject Catalyst sponsored the framework for NFT-DAO, but now, what funds are available for the DAO to make an NFT?\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\n\"Idle, Torrent\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gH7maR3XPE + \"3M Brand Rube Goldberg Machine\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEzcO3nfjZk + \"Machine 機械 Sakuga MAD 2\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TneoJDExtN4&t=262s + \"How to Create Word Cloud Text Portrait Designs!\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUum5zB8Oc + \"Matrix He is the one 1080p Full HD.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwdzYC3uUc&t=70s + \"How Trees Secretly Talk to Each Other in the Forest | Decoder.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kHZ0a_6TxY \\= Project Catalyst's First NFT ART 🌅",

    "proposal_brief": "Monetary policy is the use of monetary authority to control the supply and availability of money.  \r\nA financial operating system for the world is bound to be defined by its monetary policy - so it needs to be explored.  \r\nCardano stakeholders are the ultimate monetary authority in the Proof of Stake system and the system runs as a proxy of this authority.  \r\nHaving stakeholders in charge of a PoS system brings distinct possibilities and advantages to a PoS system that has inbuilt governance, such as Cardano. When combined with Project Catalyst / Voltaire - the possibilities are endless.  \r\nStakeholders and future partners need to identify pertinent monetary issues that will be relevant to Cardano stakeholders and to the systems structure and future development.  \r\nThis is not a Challenge designed to change the current Monetary Policy. It's aim is to explore it fully.  \r\nThe proposed budget of USD50,000 is designed to motivate sufficient proposers to be able to launch and contribute certain deliverables on the Cardano monetary policy in any form that they see fit. However, the proposed sum is not larger - as the challenge has a limited scope at the current moment of Cardano's development - yet it could potentially lead to other future initiatives, if successful.The point of the challenge is to provide scientific and economic analysis about future evolution of a revolutionary monetary system such as Cardano. There will be macro trends that need to be identified, possible scenarios that may emerge depending on adoption. The Cardano ecosystem needs to be aware of all implications.  \r\nCardano has a general Monetary Policy document available\\* The current Monetary Policy as it stands addresses two issues:\r\n\r\n*   The necessity to offer rewards for people who participate in the network\r\n*   Funding the treasury  \r\n    However, a true financial operating system for the world will eventually need to explore its Monetary Policy in more depth.  \r\n    What will a new financial operating system for the world look like? If it has governments as partners and if it has large corporate and small business partners, as well as international organizations - eventually the monetary policy will need more definition.  \r\n    Proposers should explore consequences of laissez-faire (minimum or no interference) policy - no changes to current status quo and scenarios that it may lead to  \r\n    The full range of goals of Cardano monetary policy should be identified and their implications  \r\n    Are the concepts of inflation / deflation relevant and how for Cardano? How do we measure inflation in a blockchain-based system?  \r\n    Specific monetary policy objectives that should come on the radar of Cardano stakeholders should be identified.  \r\n    Effectiveness and consequences of different monetary policy alternatives explored, even if they are small (changes to rewards systems) or large (modification of key tenets).  \r\n    Identify pros and cons of why / why not Cardano will need a monetary authority (or new solutions) and what are possible avenues ahead  \r\n    In any case, decision will have to be made about monetary policy and for decisions to be made, theoretical and practical issues need to be explored.  \r\n    In order for issues to be explored and researched - they need to be identified first.  \r\n    Right now a new economic monetary genius or crack research team is somewhere looking for a monetary system to test some revolutionary ideas on. Cardano is a system that - with its decentralized nature independent of any government - can allow for real-time research and proposals to be developed and theorized about.  \r\n    Monetary ideas or tools that were impossible or too complicated for legacy financial systems may be invented or reimagined for a new financial operating system such as Cardano.  \r\n    It might be as simple as changing the reward scheme to providing a new scale of incentives to tweaking network parameters based on developments from new economic theory.  \r\n    Cardano needs to open the door to the brightest economic minds and to open the door to the best research teams.  \r\n    This challenge is about starting to open the door, leaving it ajar for economic talent to join us.  \r\n    Important note: This is a Fund7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD50,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if this is selected as a future Challenge.  \r\n    \\* https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/cardano-monetary-policy.html",

    "proposal_brief": "++Where is a stake pool?++  \r\nIn a simpler world, it would be easy to say that a stake pool is wherever the operator and the hardware are both physically located. In reality, in our modern decentralized world, there are many more permutations. A single stake pool may have nodes running on servers in multiple countries. A team running a stake pool could be spread across the globe, having never met in person. Someone may start a stake pool while living in one place, and then move to another country and continue operating it.  \r\nFor the purpose of this challenge, I recommend that we leave the definition of \"where is the stake pool\" to the individual proposers, so long as they can meet this minimum requirement: there must be hardware running part of your stake pool or a bona fide team member living in the country you are claiming as your location. Of course, you can have more: a whole team living in one country, or all of your nodes could be running on servers in a specific place, or both.\r\n\r\n  \r\n++Long Term: Hardware Everywhere++  \r\nToday, even as more people around the world gain access to high speed internet, there are many countries where it is impractical to run a reliable stake pool due to local conditions: electrical blackouts, inconsistent network connections, government restrictions, etc. The Cardano community has a vested interest in improving the availability of network access in places where these problems exist. This challenge will serve to offer specific monetary rewards for pioneers to push the boundaries of what is possible with stake pool operations, and not be confined to the existing models. And further, this challenge will highlight the limitations that exist in specific places around the globe. After 12 months, it will be very enlightening to see exactly where the geographic gaps remain, and then additional questions can be asked and challenges formulated to improve local conditions in those places to allow Cardano to flourish in the future.  \r\n\r\n++How to Measure++\r\n\r\n*   One option is the Relays page on AdaPools.org which lists stake pool relays by the country they are operating in:\r\n\r\nhttps://adapools.org/relays\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n*   This or some other source of stake pool geographic data will be used to collect a list of countries with and without stake pools at the beginning of the challenge.\r\n*   Each individual proposal in this challenge should state which country (or countries) they plan to focus on, and success will be measured by the number of stake pools operating in that country(ies) after 12 months.\r\n\r\n++Example Solutions++\r\n\r\n*   A team or SPO who has implemented a stake pool on the Testnet but lacks the capital to initiate it on the Mainnet\r\n*   A team or SPO who will hold remote education sessions to train those in a country where no stake pools exist\r\n*   Fully loaded stake pool servers (on RasPi or traditional hardware) that can be shipped to countries for easy \"plug-n-play\" setup\r\n*   The \"Diplomat\" approach - where an experienced SPO moves to a country without a stake pool, lives there for a few months to setup a stake pool, provide hands on training and then turns over the reins to a local team.\r\n*   The \"Multinational\" approach - where an experienced SPO travels to multiple countries, sets up stake pools in each, then continues to operate them remotely from their HQ.\r\n*   Big picture efforts (infrastructure, protocols, etc.) to bring down barriers to global expansion of the network.  \r\n    \r\n\r\n++Budget Rationale++\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the actual stake amount, I feel $2,000 is the minimum that someone would need to start a stake pool completely from scratch: including the cost of hardware or cloud server fees, network connection, electricity, labor, and marketing. Based on this, and the stated goal of reaching 100 countries, I multiplied $2,000 x 100 = $200,000. My hope is that some proposed solutions will find a way to spread stake pools to more countries more efficiently than this calculated estimate. It's also entirely possible that in some countries there will be some additional financial hurdles that could necessitate much more for an individual project's budget.\r\n\r\nImportant note: This is a Fund 7 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of $200,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if this is selected as a future Challenge.",

Using a Decentralized Identification (DID) technology to establish self-sovereign presence and ownership of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) advances decentralization of institutions; benefiting individuals and entities.  \r\nThis Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards.  \r\nIt is about signaling to the world that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID that is interchangeable, interoperable (by WW DID standards) and we care deeply that the origin of our personal DID is tied to our home blockchain—Cardano.  \r\nWhile we prefer to support Atala PRISM's instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.  \r\nIt won't be lost on IOHK how the community responses to this Challenge. Should IOHK see a ground swell of great ideas and proposals, that could help them justify expediting timelines for their planned open sourcing of PRISM components.  \r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM\r\n\r\nWill Atala PRISM be open source? Yes, in a phased approach while keeping some items proprietary, has been explained in several TH and CH videos. This offers lots of room for the community to build on those standard protocols that will be open source.  \r\n\r\n++PUBLIC INFORMATION ON ATALA PRISM++\r\n\r\nIOHK is working on Atala PRISM and will be releasing it in phases with protocols open source.  \r\nBelow are details that have been publicly released from the Product Management team of Atala PRISM:  \r\n\r\nMark Griffin, Product Manager TH Jan 28, 2020 Comments\r\n\r\n\\* There is a mobile app on IOS device. We also have Android app too.  \r\n\\* The next release of the mobile Apps will have a lot more features and functionality!  \r\n\\* Not just educational degrees but it will be generic to handle the issuance of all types of credentials . E.g civic records.  \r\n\\* Currently Atala PRISM mobile apps are native. Please check them out. We have some exciting features coming in next update.  \r\n\\* The browser wallet is not available publicly yet.  \r\n\\* We are currently working on SDKS and these will be available in development portal.  \r\n\r\nDynal Patel, Senior Product Manager TH Jan 28, 20202 Comments\r\n\r\n\\* Hi everyone, We intend to open source the PRISM platform. We're working through when that will happen  \r\n\\* Also it will be possible to build many front ends for PRISM. We should mobile Apps right now but plan to extend that to other platforms, hardware included. We hope the community will build some of these too  \r\n\\* We are aligning the PRISM architecture to what is specified by DIF / W3C. Many things are specifications and not standards yet. \\* We are tracking them and contributing to standardization.  \r\n\r\nRATIONALE\r\n\r\nFeedback suggests most people need help imaging use cases for PRISM beyond turning large governments on with DIDs and can't imagine other use cases in smaller entities or organizations.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTo our thinking, while taking 4-5 years to close a country is on par for the government adoption route, addressing smaller organizations who can benefit from DID solutions, feels like a promising parallel go to market strategy the community can advance—seeding the market with DIDs by using a grassroots, early adopter, crossing-the-chasm approach.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the route crypto in general took, even now, government is slow to fully adopt crypto, so use cases in other entities can lead the charge into DID utility and best if we can bring those into the Cardano ecosystem. While 5MM DIDs in Africa is huge, 7.5B to go still leaves a lot of upside potential!  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis Challenge is about increasing self-sovereign ID worldwide, starting small with organizations and entities who can easily benefit from DID technology and not necessarily be a nation sate.\r\n\r\n++BUDGET RATIONALE++\r\n\r\nI propose a $250,000 budget which would accommodate five (5) $50K submissions on average and give each a fair shot of making something that could make a significant difference in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWHAT SHOULD BE PROPOSED\r\n\r\nProposals should be framed towards specific use-cases, and the community will know of specific cases where DIDs or Atala PRISM can be used to solve identification problems. Focusing on DID in general may be most productive, with a strong focus on Atala PRISM if it is appropriate.  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe believe many community members will have good ideas on where it could be adopted and believe at a functional level, the community has a lot to say about it.\r\n\r\nThis is important for Cardano's future and could be the base for many dApps on Cardano where it is vital to uniquely identify the other party. This is a call for exploring the possibilities where DID or specifically Atala PRISM could be one of the services that drives mass user adoption of Cardano.  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is a huge topic with importance to not only Cardano, but blockchain and cryptocurrency in general and will have a global impact.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES FOR PROPOSAL INSPIRATION\r\n\r\n++++Identifiers and Discovery++++\r\n\r\nA key piece of the decentralized identity equation is how people, organizations, and devices can be identified and located without centralized systems of identifiers (e.g. email addresses).\r\n\r\n++Authentication++  \r\nDesigning and implementing DID-based authentication across a wide variety of exchanges and use cases.\r\n\r\n++Claims and Credentials++  \r\nThe ability to verify the claims and assertions of identities is key in establishing trust among entities on a decentralized system that lacks a centralized hierarchy. Integrate DID-signed claims into apps and services.\r\n\r\n++DID Communication++  \r\nEnable secure, private and (where applicable) authenticated message-based communication, where trust is rooted in DIDs and depends on the messages themselves, not on the external properties of the transport(s) used.\r\n\r\n++Secure Data Storage++  \r\nEstablish ways for secure data storage (including personal data).  \r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CAMPAIGN BRIEF\r\n\r\nDID use case development is mission critical because user adoption will have a key role in determining the future utility and value of Cardano. That's why we are looking to the Project Catalyst community to refine and answer our challenge.  \r\nOver time, development opportunities on Cardano will evolve to include everything from DIDs, metadata to KEVM/IELE, Plutus, Marlowe and more. Ultimately, the goal here is best summarized by the question:  \r\nDid the funded DID use cases manage to drive user-adoption?  \r\nTo find out, we might track the following metrics:  \r\n\\* How many daily active users?  \r\n\\* How much daily local token volume increased?  \r\n\\* How many transactions were made?  \r\n\\* How much funds were transacted?  \r\n\r\n++Guiding questions++\r\n\r\nWhere are gaps in the market where DIDs originating on Cardano have a unique advantage?  \r\nWhat kind of DID solutions can already be developed in the next six months?  \r\nInspirational potential directions  \r\nThe community open roadmap contains a \"Use cases\" section and \"Driving adoption\" section that can serve as an inspiration for proposers.  \r\n\r\n++Developer resources++\r\n\r\nFor access to all currently available developer tools and guides, visit our developer site.
